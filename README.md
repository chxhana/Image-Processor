# Image-Processor
Welcome to the Image Processing app! This C application uses dynamic memory allocation with pointers to process images, change pixels, and edit them.

To run this app, you will need:

1. A C compiler (e.g. GCC)

Use the following command: ./image-processing [image file]

Replace [image file] with the path to the image file you want to process. The app will process the image and save the edited version to a file called output.bmp.
